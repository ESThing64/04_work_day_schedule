# A Work Day Scheduler

## What is this?

This a simple tool that you can use to track your hourly events on your 9 to 5 grind.
I uses JavaScript and bootstrap to build this application.




## How do I use it?

Okay, so you can input each task or meeting you'd like to accomplish on the hour every hour. The first step is to click on which hour you need, then write what you'd like.
   "But wait, this is just a web app. Won't I lose my all my important task if I close or refesh the page?" No sir! There is web app will store your data. If you leave this page or refesh your important info will be save. Just don't for get to press the save button!

   See the photos below!

This is how to save!
